# frontend-backend - AngularJS (frontend) + Spring Boot (backend)
## Sample project that shows the division of a application in frontend and backend.
#### The main objective is to demonstrate how a application can be divided into loosely couple components. The fronend and backend separation is extremelly important as we mostly have different developers working on each layer with different technologies.
#### This separation allow for both components to evolve separetely in its own pace. Each change can be easily tested without the need to deploy the hole application.
#### For this example we used CRL (Certificate Revogation List) as the target domain. The implemented use cases are:
    - Insert a new CRL with: Authorit Key (String) and the CRL File (CRL File).
    - Retrieve all CRLs.
    - Get the CRL file for a particular CRL.
