# Frontend sample application

## This project was designed as an example to show how an application can be splitted into loosely coupled components
## This frontend project is composed by:

* **Interface:** [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) v3.3.6

* **Engine:** [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) v1.5.5

## How to run

$ git clone https://github.com/asdcamargo/frontend-backend.git

$ cd crl-data-frontend

$ npm install

$ npm start

* A http-server will start to run on port 80. To access open a browser and go to: localhost

## How to use it

* Before performing any action in the frontend app we need to start the backend
* With the backend up and running go to the add-crl page and insert a new crl
* After that go to the CRLs page and see the newly created entry
